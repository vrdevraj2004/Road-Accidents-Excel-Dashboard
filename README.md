PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project was developed to demonstrate practical data analysis using Microsoft Excel. The goal was to work through the full lifecycle of a data project, starting with an unstructured accident dataset and ending with an interactive dashboard that highlights key trends and patterns related to road safety.

NOTE: Due to the large size of the original dataset and working files, a sample set of data was used for this demonstration.

DATASET SUMMARY

The dataset consists of detailed records of road traffic accidents, including information on location, environmental conditions, road characteristics, time of occurrence, vehicle involvement, and casualty counts. These variables enable analysis of accident frequency, severity levels, and the influence of external factors such as weather, lighting, and speed limits.

DATA CLEANING & PREPARATION IN EXCEL

All preprocessing tasks were carried out in Excel to ensure the data was reliable and consistent for analysis. The dataset was separated into dedicated worksheets for raw data, cleaned data, pivot analysis, and dashboard visualization. Duplicate entries were removed to prevent inflated counts, and categorical values were standardized to improve clarity, particularly for lighting conditions.

Date and time fields were reformatted using Excel’s built-in formatting tools to improve consistency and interpretability. These steps ensured the dataset was well-structured and suitable for efficient pivot-based analysis.

DATA ANALYSIS USING PIVOT TABLES

Excel PivotTables were used to explore relationships across multiple variables, including accident severity, road type, speed limits, weather conditions, junction control, and urban versus rural classification. PivotTables allowed for quick aggregation and comparison of accident counts and patterns across different dimensions.

DASHBOARD & DATA VISUALIZATION IN EXCEL

The insights generated from the pivot tables were presented through a centralized Excel dashboard. Visual elements include pie charts illustrating accident distribution by area type and junction control, bar and column charts showing the relationship between accident severity, speed limits, and weather conditions, and a multi-dimensional chart comparing accident severity across days of the week.

Interactive slicers for day of the week and speed limit, along with a timeline for accident dates, were integrated to allow users to dynamically filter and explore the data from different perspectives.
